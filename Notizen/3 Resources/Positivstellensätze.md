## Conditional Sage Positivstellensatz
Let $X$ be a compact convex set and G a finite set of signomials in $\mathbb{R}[X]$ [[Signomials#^1259e1|(signomial ring)]] . If $f \in \mathbb{R}[X]$  is positive on $$K:= \lbrace x \in X \vert g(x) \geq 0 \text{ for all } g \in G \rbrace,  $$ then there is an $r \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $$(\sum_{\alpha \in \mathcal{A}} e^\alpha)^r \cdot f = \lambda_f + \sum_{g\in G}\lambda_g \cdot g, $$ where $\lambda_f \in \mathbb{R}[\mathcal{A}]$ is [[Signomials#^3c075c|X-SAGE]] and each $\lambda_g \in \mathbb{R}[A]$ is [[Signomials#^989be3|posynomial]]. 

### Explanation:

If a [[Signomials#^90c48d|signomial]] is positive on a compact convex set and there a signomial that are nonnegative on this set. You can write your original signomial with this set of signomials. Scaled accordingly.

### Proof:

#### Source:
This Theorem can be found in [[Algebraic Perspectives on Sigmonial Optimization]] as Theorem 4.1.
