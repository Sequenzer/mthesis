## Definitions:

### Monomials:
A ***monomial*** is a basis-function $e^\alpha : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ definied by $$e^\alpha(x) = e^{\langle \alpha , x \rangle }$$ ^1f25d3
### Signomials:
A ***signomial*** is a finite product or a  real linear combination of [[Signomials#^1f25d3|monomials]]. ^90c48d

### Signomial Ring:
The ***signomial ring*** over $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all [[Signomials#^90c48d|Signomials]] created with $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}$  and is denoted by $\mathbb{R}[\mathcal{A} ]$ . ^1259e1

## Posynomial:
A ***posynomial*** is a [[Signomials#^90c48d|signomial]] with only nonnegative terms. ^989be3
